# Python Password Encryption
This is a simple password encryption program made from python that encrpts the word 'password' and then decrypts it.

## Inspiration
I was inspired by today's challenge for LHD: Build(Day 4).

## How we built it
I built it from python, using a tutorial.

## What it does
It encrypt the word 'password' and then decrypts it back to the original word.

## Accomplishments we're proud of
I'm proud that I figured out how to encrypt and decrypt a password using python.

## Challenges we ran into
The main problem was that I didn't know how to do it at first. I found a [tutorial](https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/5173/encrypting-passwords-for-use-with-python-and-sql-server/) that tought me how to do it.

## What we learned
I learned how to use python to encrypt and decrypt a password

## What's next for Python Password Encryption
The next thing for my Python Password Encryption program is to make it where you can input a password you want to encrypt or decrypt.
